            <h2>History of Organic Farming</h2>
            <p>Organic farming as a definable production system dates back to the 1930s and 1940s. 
                Prominent spokespersons such as J.I. Rodale, Sir Albert Howard, Lady Eve Balfour, 
                and Rudolf Steiner advocated farming methods that maintained their reliance on biological processes, 
                especially a “healthy” soil. Their comments appeared just after the “Dust Bowl” and at the time when growers 
                were first adopting commercial fertilizers and pesticides. The general philosophy suggested that natural products 
                for food production were desirable and synthetic ones were not; and healthy soils led to healthy plants that
                 resisted pest attack, while healthy plants led to healthy animals, including people.</p>

            <p>After the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, the consuming public became increasingly
                 aware of issues regarding modern farming practices. A small percentage of consumers began searching for 
                 food products grown with the organic philosophy. The environmental awareness of the 1970s led to increased
                  demand for such “organic” foods, although the aggregate production was a fraction of 1% of the total food supply.
                   During this period, buyers of organic food began to see the need for a system to verify the claims of 
                   “organically grown,” as these products usually were sold at a substantial premium price. This led to the development 
                   of the early organic certification systems, including one developed by Tilth Producers Cooperative in 
                   Washington State.</p>
